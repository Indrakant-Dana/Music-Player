# Music Player Website

This Music Player website was made only using **HTML and CSS**.
This is a part of my Full-Stack Web Development Course 🧑‍🎓.
I will be adding interactivity and making it a fully functional website soon.
Till that time, Please have a look and take some time to appreciate it
as well. 😊😄

**Note:**
 * The images used in the website are just used for educational purposes. I hold no right over them. Please don't try copyright them. If have any problem, please contact me and I will surely remove your image. 
 * This Website is made only
using HTML and CSS only. 
 * Please don't expect the buttons to work except the ones acting as the link to other webpages. I don't have knowledge of the backend yet 😞. I will fix that soon. Till that time, you have to wait 🙏.
 * I tried my best to make website responsive for smaller or larger screens. Let me know if extra changes are required. 

***Thanks a lot for visiting*** . 😊
